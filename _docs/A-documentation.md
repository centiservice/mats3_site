Mats documentation is continuously evolving. There should be enough to get you going. What I do hope will trickle in bit
by bit, is tips, tricks and techniques from experience gained after using Mats and message-based communications for
close to a decade in a substantial financial system.

### JavaDoc

Mats have pretty extensive [JavaDoc](/javadoc/), so when you need something from the API, that's where you want to go.

### Documentation @ mats3.io

Step through the navigation pane to the left! [Start here!](/docs/message-oriented-rpc) This is meant to be a guided
introduction to what Mats is. There's not much more on this site yet.

### Documentation @ github.com

This is currently where most of the prose documentation resides. First, you should read the
repo [README.md](https://github.com/centiservice/mats3#readme). After that, there are a few documents in
the [docs folder](https://github.com/centiservice/mats3/tree/main/docs#readme) of the repo. A fairly substantial 
document worth fetching a cup of coffee for is [Endpoints and Initiations](https://github.com/centiservice/mats3/blob/main/docs/developing/EndpointsAndInitiations.md). Well, make that a coffee pot, actually.

### Reach out!

Feel free to contact me if you wonder about anything! _(It would make sense to first having skimmed through the
provided documentation!)_

Any suggestions wrt. the documentation is highly appreciated.
