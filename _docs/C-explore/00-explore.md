Learning Mats<sup>3</sup> should be done both by reading documentation, but also explore, experiment, investigate
and play around with code.

## Explore Mats<sup>3</sup> using JBang. 

A set of [JBang! examples](/explore/jbang-mats/) have been created, which can be used as a base for
experimenting. [JBang](https://jbang.dev/)'s tagline is: *"Lets Students, Educators and Professional Developers create,
edit and run self-contained source-only Java programs with unprecedented ease."*, and the idea is that it can run
single-source-files which include dependencies. And Mats have a nice `MatsJbangKit` to help creating such JBang scripts.

## Read the Walkthrough

If you haven't read it yet, the [Walkthrough docs](/docs/message-oriented-rpc/) goes through the
essential features of Mats<sup>3</sup>.

## Source code of Mats<sup>3</sup>

Also, there's a page here describing the [Mats3 sources](/explore/mats-source-code/) and how it is supposed to be
nicely organized. There are quite a bit of tests that is worth skimming through - many of them have some JavaDocs and
comments which should aid understanding of what is being tested, and how you can employ the features.

## JavaDoc

Mats have pretty extensive [JavaDoc](/javadoc/), so when you need something from the API, thatâ€™s where you want to go.
