Learning Mats3 should be done both by reading documentation, but also explore, experiment, investigate
and play around with code.

To that end, a set of JBang! examples have been created, which can be used as a base for experimenting.

Also, the source code of Mats3 is hopefully nicely organized, and there is quite a bit of tests that is worth skimming
through - many of them have some JavaDocs and comments which should aid understanding of what is being tested, and how
you can employ the features.
