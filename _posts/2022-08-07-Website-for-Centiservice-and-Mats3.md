Will try to get a small website about Mats3 and MatsSocket going, to provide information about the library.

Using Github pages and Jekyll, with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.

Goals:

* "PR material" for the library - explaining what it is.
* JavaDocs published (!)
* Documentation
* Articles/blogs about how to use, and not use, messaging in a multi-service architecture.

Betting on Jekyll might be unwise, given that there are doubts whether it will be continued, e.g. this
[The Register article](https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/14/future_of_jekyll_project_engine/), linking to the
["Rip Jekyll"](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/future/rip-jekyll/) blogpost by Jared White. However, the
[Jekyll project](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
does [not seem *entirely* dead](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/code-frequency), at least.

Hopefully, since Github evidently uses it for "millions of users and sites", it will stick around a few more years. And,
since the main point of Jekyll is that it is a static Markdown/text-based solution without any complicated database,
just using some meta info in form of "Front Matter", even if it dies completely, the text will still be around.
